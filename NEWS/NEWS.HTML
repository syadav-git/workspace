          India on Thursday (September 25, 2025) carried out the successful launch of Intermediate Range Agni-Prime Missile from a Rail based Mobile launcher system.
          In a post on X, Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said, “This next generation missile is designed to cover a range up to 2000 km and is equipped with various advanced features.
          “The first-of-its-kind launch carried out from specially designed Rail based Mobile Launcher, has the capability to move on Rail network without any pre-conditions that allows User to have a cross country mobility and launch within a short reaction time with reduced visibility,” Mr. Singh added.

        <p>New Delhi, September 25, 2025 — In a major boost to India’s strategic deterrence capabilities, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), in coordination with the Strategic Forces Command (SFC), 
        successfully test-launched the Intermediate Range Agni-Prime missile from a rail-based mobile launcher system under full operational conditionsThe trial, carried out on September 24, demonstrated the missile’s ability to be transported along the national rail network and launched without fixed site constraints.
         Such mobility greatly enhances reaction time and reduces vulnerability to pre-emptive strikes.According to the press release, the rail launcher is “specially designed” to move freely over existing tracks with minimal prerequisites, enabling cross-country launch capability with reduced visibility.
        Agni-Prime is a next-generation missile with a declared strike range of up to 2,000 kilometres, built to incorporate advanced features such as canisterization, quick launch readiness, and robust communication and protection systems</p>
